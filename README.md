# Quizzical

Quizzical is a trivia quiz app built using React.js as part of Scrimba's Frontend Career Path. You can access the live demo of the application [here](https://quizzical-hinedy.netlify.app/).

## Technologies Used

- React.js for building the user interface and handling component-based architecture.
- JavaScript for implementing logic and functionality.
- HTML & CSS for structuring the user interface and applying styles.
- Figma for designing and prototyping the user interface.

## Features

- Retrieves five questions from the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/) and presents them to the user.
- Evaluates the user's answers and provides a score based on their responses.
- Implements React's event listeners to handle user interactions and trigger appropriate actions.
- Utilizes conditional rendering techniques to dynamically display content based on different quiz states.
- Effectively manages props and state in React components to maintain the application's state and trigger reactivity.
- Utilizes the `useEffect` hook to manage side effects, such as fetching data from the API, and perform actions in response to component lifecycle events.
